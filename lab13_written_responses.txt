Question 3
3a
There is a fault in the program.
    - The index range starts from 1 instead of 0, so the first input
in the vector isn't counted.

3b
There isn't a case where the fault isn't executed because if we are given
a valid input of a 10 int vector, we will ALWAYS skip the first input.
That's the fault, and it will always trigger given a valid input.

3c
A test case that executes the fault but doesn't raise an error state
would be if the first input was 1.
As that would not change the internal counto of what the absent_count should be
Input:
    attendance_count = {1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}
Expected output:
    0 (true)
Result:
    0 (true)

3d:
A test case that results in an error state but does not result in failiure would be:
an input of all zeros
Input:
    attendance_count = {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}
Expected output:
    0 (true)
Result:
    0 (true)

3e:
a test case that results in failiure would be an input that has three 0's
with one of them in the first index
Input:
    attendance_count = {0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1}
Expected output:
    0 (true)
Result:
    1 (false)
